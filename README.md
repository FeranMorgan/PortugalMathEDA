# Tableau visualization for UC Berkeley Majors
A project focused on detailing the differences in starting salaries for UC Berkeley STEM majors with emphasis on comparing applied/concentrated majors with more generalized/research oriented majors.

This Tableau story illustrates that the applied STEM majors generally have much higher starting salaries than the other STEM majors at UC Berkeley when measured at the Bachelor's level. The top 5 earners on average were: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Data Science, Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, and Statistics.
